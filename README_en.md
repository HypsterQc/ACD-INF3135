# INF3135 // Software Construction and Maintenance

In the INF3135 course, I learn the fundamentals of software construction and maintenance using the C language in a Unix/Linux environment. The syllabus covers modularity, version control, debugging, and testing. I develop skills in configuration management, writing modular code, and software performance analysis. Team-based practical assignments simulate professional environments to prepare me for real-world software development.
